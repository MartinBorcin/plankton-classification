# plankton-classification

This repository contains jupyter notebook(s) that fine-tune a pre-trained VGG16 model for plankton image classification. It has been developed during my Computer Science studies at University of Glasgow as a coursework assignment for a Deep Learning course.

- `report_training.ipynb` contains the full code for data loading, training, hyper-parameter optimization, and evaluation along with all explanations, analysis and reasoning behind the design. 
- `report_no_training.ipyng` is almost completely identical to the above with the exception that it skips the execution of the cells in the training and hyper-parameter optimization sections and simply uses the trained weights downloaded from google drive.

The code can be run on Google Colab or a local jupyter instance.
